## [9.2.0][] - 2018-5-22

### Added

* New "session info" page containing the former content of the "About" page
  (uportal-app-framework version info, app info JSON) (#755)
  * To use: Add the `'portal/help/routes'` module in your main.js file (#765)
* App config option `aboutPageURL` to get text and links for "About" page (#755)

* Widgets with overlays can be removed (#760)
* Notifications' action buttons now open in new tab (#762)

### Removed

## [9.1.0][] - 2018-4-17


### Added

* `showAllMessages` beta setting. When true disables all client-side message
  filtering. Useful for demos and testing. (#742)

### Changed

* `list-of-links` now offers tooltip with full title when it truncates any link
  title, not just those presented via `circle-button`s (#736)
* RSS widgets now offer tooltip with full title when truncating item titles
  (#737)
* Data urls only called when necessary (#747)

### Fixed

* `list-of-links` widgets are now `basic` widgets in the zero links edge case
  (#735)
* `list-of-links` now `aria-label`s links, ensuring a non-truncated version of
  the link label is available to browsers (#736)

### Removed

* Support for `APP_OPTIONS.optionsTemplateURL` configuration is removed in this
  release. It had previously been documented as "deprecated" but the
  backwards-compatibility support didn't work out (#744), so in practice support
  for this feature was already removed as a breaking change for the `9.x`
  version series. (#745)

### Deprecated

The `disableGroupFilteringForMessages` beta setting is deprecated. While it
still works in this release, the new `showAllMessages` beta setting is intended
to replace it. `disableGroupFilteringForMessages` will have no effect in some
future release. (#742)

## [9.0.2][] - 2018-3-30

This release is to mop up some weirdness which happened with 9.0.1 and get a
clean artifact.

### Changed

* Minor CHANGELOG change
  (#731)
* Fix positioning of frame-page title when using on-page side navigation (#738)

## [9.0.1][] - 2018-3-29

BREAKING CHANGE:

This release fixes a bug in client-side filtering of `messages.json`. (#730)
Apps using this release or later will not have this bug. However, before relying
upon the previously broken group filtering in a `messages.json` shared across
multiple uPortal App Framework applications, all participating applications
would need to be upgraded to this version or later to avoid showing messages to
audiences for whom they may not have been intended.

### Added
* Adds resetters to user-settings page (#724)
* `circle-button` now offers tooltip with full title when title is truncated
  (#727)

### Changed

* Out of the box example `list-of-links` widget now more self-documenting
  (#727, #729)

### Fixed

* `circle-button` no longer truncates `aria-label` representation of title
  (#727)
* Message filtering now more precise (#730)

### Build engineering


### Documentation

* DEPRECATED: Font Awesome icons for `list-of-links` links. Use Material Icons
  instead. (#727)
* Modest improvements to `list-of-links` widget type documentation (#727)
* Adds glossary (#725)

## [9.0.0][] - 2018-3-21

### Breaking changes

* Removed jQuery UI sortable dependency (#721)
* Removed `<app-header>` directive. This affects any framework apps using that
  directive outside of `<frame-page>`. `<frame-page>` usages should be
  unaffected. (#684)
* With the removal of the `<app-header>`, the `APP_OPTIONS.optionsTemplateURL`
  config has been removed, superseded by a new `APP_OPTIONS.appMenuTemplateURL`.
  Templates may require minor layout/appearance adjustments for use in the new
  way. (#684)

To upgrade:

* Add jQueryUI Sortable to frame app, or refer to
  [an example of angular-drag-and-drop-lists][uportal-home #795]
* If using the "app-title" attribute on frame-page directive, that title will be
  used as the document title
* Pages formerly using `app-header` can use the `page-title` attribute on
  `frame-page` to achieve a similar within-page `h1` heading as before.
* Port forward `APP_OPTIONS.optionsTemplateURL` usages to
  `APP_OPTIONS.appMenuTemplateURL` usages. This content will now appear in the
  side navigation and may likely need a bit of tweaking if using a rigid
  CSS layout.

Also, this release fixes a bug in presenting mascot announcements. (#697).
Before relying upon a shared `messages.json` using the fixed mascot announcement
feature, all apps sourcing those messages will need to be upgraded to this
version or later to avoid showing users a broken mascot announcement experience.

### Added

* `mainService` now offers `computeWindowTitle(...)` (#679)
* `<frame-page>` directive now offers `page-title` attribute to add a `<h1>`
  tag with the app icon and title to the page (#684)
* When side navigation is open, keyboard focus will remain inside the menu and
  cycle through menu options until it's closed (#707)
* Logs the dynamic list-of-links response in some dynamic list-of-links error
  cases (#715)
* Core Infrastructure Initiative badge (#711)

### Changed

* `<frame-page>` sets document title per existing `app-title` attribute (#682)
* The `show-add-to-home` attribute on the `<frame-page>` directive now displays
  a dismissible-for-session toast message prompting users to add the app to
  their home page, instead of a button. (#684)
* `vm.showMessagesFeatures` variable moved out of default and into more
  logically appropriate spot (#694)
* Improved appearance of add-to-home toast message (#706)

### Fixed

* External links in mascot announcements now work again. (#697)
* "Skip to main content" link now skips more repeated navigation to reach
  closer to the main content. (#698) (#705)
* Label widget cover dismiss button as "OK" rather than "Continue" (#675)
* Fixed widget in-app message example (#714)

### Build engineering

* Update package lockfile with updated dependencies (#704)
* Update stylelint to version 9.1.3 (#718)

### Documentation

* About dynamically sourcing `list-of-links` widget content (#717)

## [8.0.0][] - 2018-01-08

### Breaking Changes

*   Moves the data object in messages out of the audience object and into a
  separate object. This will affect installations that have configured a
  messages.json file. (#649)
*   Removes a route formerly used to catch a localStorage error (#643)

*   To upgrade:
    - If your app's main.js file uses the `'/sorry-safari'` route, remove it
    - Also remove the corresponding url-pattern from your app's web.xml file

When upgrading a shared `messages.json` to use this new structure, all apps
sourcing that shared `messages.json` will need to be upgraded to this version
or later of the framework, in a coordinated manner.

Also, this release adds other features for sourcing some message content via
additional dynamic callback rather than statically in `messages.json`. Before
relying upon these features all apps sourcing a shared `messages.json` will
need to be upgraded to this version or later.

This release also fixes message filtering by date. Before relying upon this
feature all apps participating in a shared `messages.json` will need upgraded
to this release or later to avoid the not-yet-upgraded apps displaying premature
or expired messages.

### Added

* track clicks on sidenav footer links (#642)
* add documentation clarifying major upgrades (#647)
* add the ability to set message title via an external data source (#649)
* add the ability to set a message more info button url via an external data
  source (#649)

### Changed

* update documentation to read more and state intent more clearly (#632)
* update to latest version (2.0) of karma (#652)

### Fixed

* synch priority header with bell (#638)
* filter messages where today is outside of start and end dates (#639)
* allow priority notification buttons to display full button text (#640)
* catch localStorage error with IE (#643)
* implemented filter messages by date (#650)

### Build engineering

* add documentation stating intent to use Conventional commits and tips on how
  to comply (#634)
* leverage commitlint travis helper (#621)
* update to latest version (6.0.0) of lint-staged (#631)
* move some git commit hooks to be optionally installed (#635)
* suppress `eslint` on `docs/` when linting staged changes (#636)
* require npm 5.6.0 or higher (#644)
* resolved appveyor require.js flakiness (#645)

## [7.0.0][] - 2017-11-30

### BREAKING CHANGES

Updates to the side navigation feature in this release introduce a hard
dependency on the `<frame-page>` directive for unbroken menu experience (#588).

**If upgrading from 6.1.0**
and the application already configures side navigation (by setting values for
either `appMenuTemplateURL` or `appMenuItems` in `override.js`), every main
view in the app must use the `<frame-page>` directive as its outermost container
element. Applications that have not previously configured side navigation and
do not begin using side navigation with this upgrade should not be affected by
this change.

There are also CSS changes to the layout container elements that precede the
`<ng-view>` element (where the app's on-page content is pulled in) to prefer a
flex-based layout (#588).

This may affect an application if:

* It has a lot of elements with a defined `min-width` property
* It is already using flex positioning but is not using `flex-wrap` on
  containers with a lot of content
* It has many elements with `position: absolute` (may experience a minor

Examples of the kinds of downstream changes required:

* uPortal-home [change to use `<frame-page>` in some views][uportal-home #739]
  and [in the rest of the views][uportal-home #742]
* uPortal-home had to further adjust [to accommodate flex-based
  layout][uportal-home #747]
* uPortal-home [updated the app directory entry details page with plain
  CSS][uportal-home #750] to cope with this change

Also, this release adds support for dynamic notification text sourced from a
JSON web service (#601). Before relying upon this feature in a shared
`messages.json` all participating apps must be first upgraded to use this
framework version or later, otherwise they will not reflect the new dynamic
notification content.

### Features

* Add on-page side navigation feature (#588) + To use: Set
  `APP_OPTIONS.enablePushContentMenu` to true in your override.js file
* Add more Google Analytics around notifications (#598). Events for + rendering
  priority (banner across the top) notification + dismissing priority
  notification + rendering notification by opening the bell menu + clicks on
  mobile side-nav notification bell, with and without priority
  indicator + dismissing notification from the bell menu + dismissing or
  restoring notification from notifications page
* Support dynamic notification text sourced from JSON web service (#601)

### Fixed

* Improves top bar accessibility (#594)
* Fix the `search-with-links` widget type (#585)
* Fix footer link style to avoid off-by-one-pixel misalignment (#586)
* Fix separator character between footer links (#587, #590)
* Clarify safety of `/settings` tooling to reset in-browser state. (#600)
* Fix notification rendering robustness against duplicate ids (#602, #603)

### Refactor

* Use `moment.js` in `time-sensitive-content` widget type (#593)

### Build engineering

* Now runs `commitlint` on `travis-ci`, removing `precommit` hook that
  previously verified commit messages locally. (#581)
* Now sets Java 8 rather than 7 as source and target version (#591)

Note that this project only incidentally uses Java and Maven. In the future
this front-end product may not use Java at all. (Server-side services uPortal
app framework relies upon might still use Java, of course.)

### Code style

* Fix a bunch of JSDoc warnings (#598)

## [6.1.0][] - 2017-10-18

* Hides notification bell when on notification page (#572)
* Update release documentation (#557)
* Fix app hangs when promise returns undefined (#575)
* Fix bug where notification bell still showed on notification page (#576)
* Add error message when notifications fail (#577)
* Fix spacing error if no configurable side navigation is used (#583)
* Allow unbroken experience when opting-out of portal-wide notifications (#611)
* Fix accessibility bug where screen reader/keyboard navigation couldn't access
  notifications/announcements (#613)
* Clarify that side navigation subheader is not a link (#617)

## [6.0.3][] - 2017-09-29

* fix(messages): return nothing on filter fail (#554)

## [6.0.2][] - 2017-09-29

BREAKING CHANGE: This release fixes priority notifications (#553). Before
relying upon fixed notifications in a shared messages source, all participating
apps must first be upgraded to this release or later to avoid improperly bound
URLs in priority notifications as presented in not-yet-upgraded apps.

* Properly bind URLs in priority notifications (#553)
* Eliminate gap between top bar on mobile (#552)
* Add Google Analytics events to notifications (#550)
* renaming angularjs-portal to uportal-home (#549)

## [5.1.0][] - 2017-09-01

BREAKING CHANGES: This release adds a feature to mascot announcements for adding
a widget to home directly from the announcement. Before relying upon this
feature in a shared messages source, all participating applications must first
be upgraded to this framework version or later to avoid displaying broken
announcements in not-yet-upgraded applications.

### Messages Enhancements

* Adds actionbutton and more info button to features page and priority
  notifications (#504)
* Adds 'addToHome' functionality directly from mascot announcement (#506)
  (#512)
* Fixes bug with notification urls not being resolved correctly (#507)

### Code Maintenance and Enhancements

* Updates karma to latest version (#511)
* Adopts Conventional Commits (#487)
* Adds additional project status badges (#510)

## [5.0.0][] - 2017-08-24

Version 5.0.0 of uPortal-App-Framework consists of 67 pull requests over more
than three months of work.

The major change featured in this release is the consolidation of notifications,
features, and announcements into the messages data model.
[Documentation for creating messages can be found here.](http://uportal-project.github.io/uportal-app-framework/messaging-implementation.html)

This release also features a new Action Items widget type, and added
functionality to the List of Links widget type. We've added support for a
generic uPortal theme, various usability enhancements, and the start of a more
personalized avatar space.

We've updated our documentation to keep up with our changes as well as welcomed
@ChristianMurphy as a new Committer. Christian has been instrumental in
upgrading our Continuous Integration process as well as adding a new Dependency
Management service to our repository.

While we're proud of what we've accomplished in this major release, we hope to
return to a faster paced release cycle in the future.

### How to Upgrade from version 3.X

* Change dependency to version 4.0.0
* For upgrading application consuming notifications programmatically: the [notification service api changed from `getNotificationsByGroups` to `getFilteredNotifications`](https://github.com/uPortal-Project/uportal-app-framework/pull/386/files#diff-9a244329b1c0f99008f0fb506d3b9c64L159). This will not be a concern for most (if not all) applications.
* If the app had previously named services and directives with the word "widget"
  in the name, naming conflicts may arise due to the new Widget directives and
  services being added. [See the code for more details](https://github.com/uPortal-Project/uportal-app-framework/pull/385/files).
  This will not be a concern for most applications.

### Major Version Upgrade

* Upgrade angular-ui-bootstrap and angular libraries (#350) from 0.13.4 to 2.2.0

The `angular-ui-bootstrap` upgrade moves up 2 major versions and does
break compatibility with some older components. If the app used any
`angular-ui-bootstrap` components, it will need to begin prefixing them with
`uib-`. See `angular-ui-bootstrap` [Migration Guide for Prefixes](https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/wiki/Migration-guide-for-prefixes).

### Build changes

* Add postcss/autoprefixer to uw-frame build (#345)
* Remove dependency on Grunt (#335)
* Break docs submodule dependency (#337)
* Tweaked build.js (#348)

### Material

* Upgrade uw-frame to Angular Material 1.1 (#339)

### Miscellaneous fixes

* Fix for Safari private browsing bug (#347)
* Added ability to have a name for the default theme (#336)
* Fixed format for announcement end date (#332)
